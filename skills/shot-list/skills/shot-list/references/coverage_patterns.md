# Coverage Patterns Reference

Common approaches for covering different scene types.

## Dialogue Scene Coverage

### Standard Two-Person Coverage

**Minimum shots needed:**
1. **Master** (2S or WS) - Entire scene, establishes geography
2. **OTS A→B** - Over character A to character B
3. **OTS B→A** - Over character B to character A
4. **Clean Single A** (MCU/CU) - Character A reactions
5. **Clean Single B** (MCU/CU) - Character B reactions

**Enhanced coverage adds:**
- Walking/entering shots
- Insert shots (props, hands)
- Cutaways (environment)
- Additional angles for key moments

### Triangle Coverage (3+ Characters)

1. **Master** - All characters
2. **Two-shots** - Each pairing
3. **Singles** - Each character
4. **Group reactions** - 2 characters responding

### Walk-and-Talk Coverage

1. **Leading tracking** - Camera ahead of subjects
2. **Following tracking** - Camera behind subjects
3. **Profile tracking** - Camera beside subjects
4. **Stationary pickup** - For specific lines
5. **POV** - What they're walking toward/past

## Action Scene Coverage

### Fight Sequence

1. **Wide master** - Geography, full bodies
2. **Medium action** - Key exchanges
3. **Close-ups** - Impacts, reactions
4. **Inserts** - Weapons, hands, feet
5. **POV** - Incoming attacks
6. **Reaction shots** - Observers (if any)

### Chase Sequence

1. **Wide establishing** - Route/environment
2. **Tracking pursuer** - Following the chase
3. **Tracking pursued** - Being chased POV
4. **Intercuts** - Both parties
5. **Obstacle shots** - What they navigate
6. **Close-ups** - Determination, fear

### Vehicle Scene

1. **Exterior tracking** - Vehicle in motion
2. **Interior master** - All occupants
3. **Driver single** - Over steering wheel
4. **Passenger singles** - Each occupant
5. **POV road** - Windshield view
6. **Insert** - Speedometer, mirror, hands

## Emotional Scene Coverage

### Revelation/Reaction

1. **Two-shot setup** - Before the moment
2. **Speaker medium** - Delivering news
3. **Slow push** - On reactor during delivery
4. **Close-up reaction** - Immediate response
5. **Wide pullback** - Aftermath, isolation
6. **Detail insert** - Object if relevant

### Intimate/Romantic

1. **Two-shot profile** - Silhouettes, equal framing
2. **Close-ups** - Each character, soft lighting
3. **Extreme close** - Eyes, lips, hands
4. **Over-shoulder** - Soft, intimate angles
5. **Wide for choreography** - If physical

## Establishing Coverage

### Location Introduction

1. **Extreme wide** - Geography, scale
2. **Wide** - Building/area
3. **Medium** - Entrance/focal point
4. **Detail** - Signage, unique feature
5. **Character entrance** - Into location

### Time Passage Montage

1. **Clock/watch insert**
2. **Window (day→night)**
3. **Activity progression**
4. **Calendar pages**
5. **Seasonal markers**

## Coverage Planning Tips

### The 180° Rule
- Draw imaginary line between subjects
- Keep all cameras on same side
- Crossing creates disorienting "jump"
- Break intentionally only for effect

### 30° Rule
- Each shot should differ by at least 30°
- Prevents jarring "jump cuts"
- Exception: intentional jump cuts for effect

### Screen Direction
- Maintain consistent movement direction
- Character moving left→right should continue
- Breaking creates disorientation

### Shot Size Progression
- Cut between different shot sizes
- Similar sizes feel like mistakes
- MS→CU good, MS→MS awkward

### Coverage Economy
- Shoot widest shots first (more setup visible)
- Move to tighter shots as day progresses
- Group shots by camera position/setup
- Plan around actor availability

## Setup Grouping Strategy

Group shots by camera position to minimize moves:

**Setup 1** (Wide position):
- Master wide
- Any wide coverage

**Setup 2** (Character A side):
- OTS to Character B
- Character A singles

**Setup 3** (Character B side):
- OTS to Character A
- Character B singles

**Setup 4** (Insert position):
- Detail shots
- Props
- Hands

## Shot List Notation Examples

### Scene: INT. OFFICE - DAY (Two characters arguing)

| Shot | Setup | Type | Framing | Move | Description |
|------|-------|------|---------|------|-------------|
| 1A | 1 | WS | Wide office | STATIC | Master - entire argument |
| 1B | 1 | MS | 2S desk | STATIC | Both characters, tension |
| 1C | 2 | OTS | Over Tom to Mary | STATIC | Mary's accusations |
| 1D | 2 | MCU | Mary clean | STATIC | Mary close coverage |
| 1E | 3 | OTS | Over Mary to Tom | STATIC | Tom's defense |
| 1F | 3 | CU | Tom reaction | PUSH | Tom realizes truth |
| 1G | 4 | INS | Desk photo | STATIC | Family photo - stakes |
| 1H | 1 | WS | Wide | STATIC | Mary exits, Tom alone |
