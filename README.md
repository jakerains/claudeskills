## What Are Skills?

Skills extend AI coding agents with:

- **Specialized Knowledge** — Domain expertise the agent can reference
- **Workflows** — Step-by-step processes for complex tasks
- **Tools & Scripts** — Executable code for deterministic operations
- **Best Practices** — Patterns and conventions for specific technologies

Once installed, your agent automatically loads relevant skills based on context.
